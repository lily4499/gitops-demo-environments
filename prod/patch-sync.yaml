# Prod sync behavior (conceptual documentation)
# In this project, Prod is expected to:
# - use manual sync (no auto-sync) for safer rollouts
# - optionally ignore certain diffs like /spec/replicas to avoid noisy drift
#
# The actual syncPolicy & ignoreDifferences must be configured in the
# ApplicationSet or ArgoCD Application definition.
